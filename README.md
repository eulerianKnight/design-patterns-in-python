# Design Patterns in Python.

## Design Patterns are typically spit into three categories. This is called as Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors.

### 1. Creational Patterns
- Deal with creation (construction) of objects.
- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)

### 2. Structural Patterns

- Concerned with structure (e.g. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface.
- Stress the importance of good API Design.

### 3. Behavioral Importance

- They are all different; no central theme.
